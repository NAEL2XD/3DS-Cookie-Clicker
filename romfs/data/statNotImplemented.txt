Hello and thanks for being
curious about the stats
button, unfortunately
in v0.4.0, the stats has
broke a hard amount and
just does not work anymore

I tried numerous amounts of
ways to fix this and nothing
would ever work, like ever.

So the stats button is here
for nothing and the only
reward for clicking on there
is a blue led that does
show a notification (like me)

SO yeah, thanks for checking out
the stats button, have a wonderful
clicking journey.
