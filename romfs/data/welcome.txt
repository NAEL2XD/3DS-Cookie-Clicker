Welcome to my own made
cookie clicker.
~Where gaining cookies gets way
too addictive.~

Why do you see this? The reason
you're seeing this is because you
do not have a save file in

sdmc:/Nael2xd/CookieClicker/save.txt

Spend some cookies on products,
see your stats on bottom right,
and try to gain as many cookies
as possible. Just don't spend way
too much time on it! :`)

Have fun in cookie clicker!! The
game is always being updated
and you can check back for
updates on Universal Updater!
Enjoy!!
