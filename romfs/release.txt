Welcome to Cookie Clicker v0.4.0!

In version v0.4.0, there are
new additions, fixes, or even
some stuff that i've done!

Here's what's new in v0.4.0:
■ Added Notifications
■ Added Error Popup
■ Added Easter Egg from the
error popup, do you notice it?
■ Add Product Own Counter
■ Fixed a bug where checksum
files doesn't exist causing
a crash.

The game is still in
developement, so most of
the ui, product, and many
other things will be subjected
to change!

Thank you for reading this,
and have a good clicking day!!
